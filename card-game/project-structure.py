Nope this is too hard.
instead of separate functions calling draw animations,
we could use a dictionary to store those values, in this case it would be playerHealth = 100
bossHealth = 100, then we could add hitplayer = x, hitboss = y, spelltodraw = playerattack1
Then we pass this dict into a drawing function (dict), that will for example check
difference in health and draw the change, draw the spell, draw death animation, etc
Essentially have all drawing related functions in one function.
